# CompetitionJudgingPlatform
# Background
This is an ASP.NET application that allows instituitions/organisations to host/manage competitions and for participants to join and participate in them. 
# Features
## Google Sign-In
This application uses Google's OAuth Token to validate users. This gives them the option to sign in using their existing Google accounts instead of creating a new local account.
## Comments
Participants can also view and comment on fellow participant's submission in a social media-style view. They can even vote for their favourite submissions!
## Centralised management
This application can tell if a user is a competitor, judge or administrator. It allows them to have a centralised space:
- for competitors to: Sign up for competitions; Submit their work
- for judges to: View and grade submissions; Set grading criterias
- for administrators to: Add and delete competitions; Add and remove judges from competitions

And much more!
